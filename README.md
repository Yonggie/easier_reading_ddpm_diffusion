# Algorithm in notation
![](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/DDPM-algo.png)

# Why is it easier to read
I did not use mean or variance in terminology, instead, I just follow the equation and used the ``term1``, ``term2``, etc. .
I added some notation besides the variable in Chinese.

# Run
This is just a easier to read version of [his Diffusion implementation](https://github.com/zoubohao/DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-).
You may just follow his project instructions to run.

In case u insist to run my model:
Download [his git project](https://github.com/zoubohao/DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-) and replace ``Diffusion.py`` in ``Diffusion/Diffusion.py``.
Then follow his readme to run the project.
